# boring_calculator
A generic, basic and likely broken calculator. Made using [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/).
From this, I was able to learn optimisation using different classes to more readily control events, create a calculation script that handles the addition,
subtraction, multiplication and divison of integers in a display(string), and able to enhance user readability through fonts and visible buttons, and
further enhancing my knowledge in developing software. 



Made by myself, Thomas Steel, using the Open-Source wxWidgets GUI community project. Use of this executable does not require external download of the GUI, but recompilation and editing of source code does require the GUI.
